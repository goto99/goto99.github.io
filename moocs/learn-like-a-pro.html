        <h3 id="1.1">1.1 Learning means linking</h3>
        <h4>Key Ideas</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning well means creating strong neural links in long-term memory.</li>
            <li>Retrieval practice is the best technique to help you build strong links in long-term memory.</li>
            <li>It’s possible to make dramatic improvements in your learning—even related to topics you thought you could never learn.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p> How much information can you store in your brain? Oh, maybe a petabyte. That's about 4.7 billion books. 
            In other words, <strong>you have more space in long-term memory than you could ever fill up. When you're learning, the problem isn't storage capacity.
            It's getting information into long-term memory and making it stick.</strong> <br/>
           <strong>Brain: built up with 86 billions of Neurons; Neuron: consists of axon and dendrites which have many little spines on them.</strong> <br/>
            <strong>What happens in a learning process: neurons connects together to form links with one another in your long-term memory. </strong> <br/>
            Complex knowledge vs. complex links. <br/>
            Strong sets of links means learning and remembering something well. <br/>
            Weak sets of links means starting forgetting.<br/>
 
            So to learn something well, you have to create strong sets of links that don't easily break up.
            And that's what this course is about. Based on neuroscience and cognitive psychology,
            we will give you the best tools for creating strong links in long-term memory. <br/>
     
            How do you build links when you're learning?
            And how do you make them stick?
            That's the burning question.
            <strong>The best way to learn and make new links stick is by testing yourself.</strong><br/>
            This is also called <strong>retrieval practice</strong>, because you're retrieving the information from your own memory links.
            So don't reread or underline to try to make information stick.
            Instead, challenge yourself to retrieve the key ideas.
            When you learn something from an instructor, video, or book, it creates a weak set of links.
            But each time you pull that information from your memory by retrieving it, and without looking at the answer,
            you strengthen those links.
            If you're learning new vocabulary, test yourself with flash cards.
            Or when reading, close the book and try to recall as much as possible from the page or the chapter.
            And when you solve problems, try on your own to solve those problems before looking at the answer key.
            You'll find that not only do you learn the material much faster and better this way
            but you understand it more deeply, too.

        <h3 id="1.2">1.2 How to overcome procrastination and focus intently</h3>
        <h4> Key Ideas </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning happens more swiftly when you avoid multitasking.</li>
            <li>The Pomodoro Technique is a good way to sustain your focus and avoid distractions or multitasking.</li>
            <li>Taking brief, five-minute breaks after approximately 25 minutes of studying can help your brain process new learning, 
                so what you’ve just been learning isn’t overwritten.</li>
            <li>When you take a five-minute break, try to avoid anything that requires focus, such as checking emails or social media.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Procrastination.
            Why does it happen?
            When you just THINK about a boring task, you feel pain in a pain processing center of the brain, the insular cortex.
            But the pain goes away instantly once you switch your focus to a funny YouTube video, a computer game or something else you like.
            No wonder people procrastinate!
            The problem with procrastination is you don't actually do what you need to do. Later on, you pay the price.
            But if you can just find a way to start working on a boring task,
            it doesn't take long for that pain in the insular cortex to go away.
            And the best way we've found to dive into doing just that is with the Pomodoro Technique.
            It was invented by Italian Francesco Cirillo,
            who named the technique after his tomato-shaped timer.<br/>
            Doing a Pomodoro is super simple.
            It also goes along with everything we know from neuroscience about how to sharpen your focus
            and learn faster and deeper.
            First, clear your desk and get rid of anything that could distract you.
            No pings from your cell phone or your computer!
            Then set a timer for 25 minutes.
            Work as intently as you can for those 25 minutes.
            Once you're done, take a rewarding break for about 5 minutes.
            Listen to your favorite song, close your eyes and relax,
            make a cup of tea, something you enjoy, even if it's just moving around and being sort of mindless. 
            If you do four of these 25-minute Pomodoro sessions and short breaks, you can then take a longer break.
            Or, if you get into a good flow during one session and want to continue beyond 25 minutes, you can.
            The Pomodoro is quite flexible. And you can experiment with what works best.<br/>
   
            So why is the Pomodoro so powerful?
            Well, anyone, even me, me can focus for about 25 minutes.
            And guess what, after twenty minutes or so, that pain in the insular cortex disappears!
            You start getting into the flow, enjoying your studies or your work even while you're training your brain to keep its focus.
            There's another reason why the Pomodoro is so powerful, and this is also why those 5-minute breaks can be so important when you're learning.
            When you take in new knowledge, weak sets of links are created in long-term memory in the neocortex.
            During breaks, the hippocampus, a sort of helper to long-term memory, indexes those links, making it easier to know what is stored where.
            Your hippocampus also helps your long-term memory practice and create better and stronger links.
            But if you study for too long without a break, the hippocampus can become overwhelmed.
            That means it can't do its job properly.
            The result?
            The new information doesn't get stored.
            This is why mental breaks after 25 minutes or so can help.
            It's best to take these breaks without using your laptop or mobile phone.
            <strong>Transfer of information to long-term memory works best when you simply relax, doing something mindless.</strong>
            You might think "well, I'll just sneak a peek at my cell phone during break".
            Hah, you do that, next thing that happens, you're texting or you're answering an email,
            and THAT'S not relaxing!
            You'll start overwhelming your hippocampus, and instead of letting the hippocampus index and reinforce the information in long-term memory,
            you're just letting it overflow.
            Even just having a cell phone near you can be distracting.<br/>
            One study showed that people on average checked for messages every 35 seconds when messenger apps were left open.
            Another study found that students who used their mobile phones in class took fewer notes, remembered less, and scored a letter grade lower on a test.
            So when you're learning, put the phone in do-not disturb mode, out of reach, and out of sight.
            And if there's anything else in your environment that can distract you, remove it.
            Or find a better place to study.
            Because one of the best ways to avoid losing to distractions is making sure there are none.
            If there's noise you cannot remove, get earplugs, earmuffs, or noise-canceling headphones.
            They also send others a do not disturb signal.<br/>
            And <strong>avoid task-switching</strong>, such as alternating between reading and sending e-mails.
            Whenever you switch to another task, you have to activate another part of your brain.
            This takes time and effort, known as switching costs.<br/>

            If you become cognitively fixated on the wrong approach, you can waste a lot of time.
            If you're trying to figure something out,
            sometimes a brief glance out a window, or a look at something else,
            can get your brain out of the rut and help you to more easily solve the problem.
        </p>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>Pomodoro Technique: 25-50 minutes intensively learning plus 5 minutes break period.<br/>
            Just relaxing or doing something mindlessly during break helps the hippocampus index and reinforce the information learned in long-term memory.<br/>
            Remove distractions and avoid multitasking or task-switching in one Pomodoro period.

        <h3 id="1.3">1.3 How to overcome being stuck</h3>
        <h4>Key Ideas </h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Learning involves two fundamentally different modes of thinking: focused and diffuse. Focused mode is when you are paying close attention 
                to what you are learning. Diffuse mode is when your mind wanders</strong>, e.g. when you are taking a walk or falling asleep.</li>
            <li>You often alternate between focused and diffuse modes during the learning process.</li>
            <li>The diffuse mode (taking a break!) is important in helping you figure out especially tough problems.</li>
            <li>The “Hard Start” Technique can help you get credit for tougher problems on tests. It involves starting with a test or assignment’s hardest problem 
                and then pulling yourself off it when you get stuck and returning to it later instead. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Getting stuck and frustrated when you're learning is common.
            But knowing a little bit about how your brain works can help unstick you faster and reduce your frustration.
            Your brain has two modes for thinking and learning.
            We'll call them the focused mode and the diffuse mode.
            You're in focused mode when you're concentrating hard on something, like when you're trying to understand a paragraph,
            or you're listening intently or working out a problem.
            But when you don't focus on anything in particular, you're in the diffuse mode.
            For example, you're in diffuse mode when random thoughts pop up when you're standing in the shower,
            or riding a bus or maybe taking a walk.
            <strong>When you're in the diffuse mode, your brain can solve problems and connect ideas,
            which is why many people get good ideas when they go for a walk, take a shower or are falling asleep.</strong>
            If you're learning a new word or solving a simple multiplication problem,
            all you need is the focused mode.
            But what about when you struggle to understand how a refrigerator works
            or integral calculus?
            You might focus hard, but still not get it.
            Surprisingly, taking a break for a few hours or overnight often works wonders.
            That's because the diffuse mode comes alive during breaks and sleep.
            To understand these two modes, it helps to think about the brain as a maze,
            with learned concepts stored as sets of links in different parts of the maze.
            When you're in the focused mode, you move along these sets of links.
            For example, you're in focused mode when you solve multiplication problems or carefully aim to throw a basketball into the basket.
            The diffuse mode, on the other hand, is like a set of tiny drones that can zip quickly over parts of the maze.
            These drones can easily make connections between different parts of the brain that normally aren't connected.
            Those new connections are what you need when you are struggling to find a solution.
            Once the diffuse mode helps you realize a new insight, the focused mode can help build and strengthen the new idea.
            But then you might get stuck again on a new section of the problem, and have to switch again to the diffuse mode.
            Learning often involves going back and forth like this between the focused and the diffuse modes.
            So what's the best way to get into the diffuse mode?
            Well first, you've got to focus hard on the topic or problem until you're pretty well stuck.
            Then STOP focusing.
            You can switch to another topic, that's a wise choice if you've got a lot to learn or do.
            But the diffuse mode can work even faster if you simply relax or do mindless activities
            such as brushing your teeth, doing the dishes, or going for a walk.
            Working from a coffee shop with the hum of background conversations and occasional clanking of cups
            can help you fall momentarily into the diffuse mode.
            This can help you avoid cognitive fixation, and can be helpful if you need to brainstorm ideas or write a report.
            This also brings us to the "Hard Start Technique", which takes advantage of your diffuse mode when solving difficult problems at home or on tests.
            We like it because the technique is so darn simple!
            First, scan over the test or worksheet and mark any problems that seem especially hard.
            Second, begin working on whatever seems like it's the hardest problem.
            You'll probably get stuck after a minute or two.
            Third, as soon as you find yourself getting stuck, move to an easier problem.
            And fourth, and finally, after you've done one or several easier problems, return to the hard problem.
            You'll find yourself making progress!
            This happens because while your attention was focusing on the easier problem,
            your diffuse mode was using its drones behind the scenes on the harder problem.
           
            Were you taking notes while you were watching?
            That could be a good idea, but if you were in a face-to-face physical classroom, it might actually be a bad idea.
            Why?
            We'll explain this and more in the next video.
            In the meantime, head on over to the discussion forum and share tips about how to focus better, or how you like to get into the diffuse mode.</p>

        <h3 id="1.4">1.4 How to maximize your working memory</h3>
        <h4>Key Ideas </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Your working memory can only grab and temporarily hold onto a maximum of about four simple concepts or ideas.</li>
            <li>If you have already stored information as neural links in long-term memory, your working memory can grab onto it. In this way, working memory 
                can hold and manipulate much more complex pieces of information, even if it can still only hold onto about four things.</li>
            <li>Online videos are easier to learn from, because you can hear and see explanations. They also allow you to easily take notes—you can stop the video if you are confused.</li>
            <li>In-person lectures can be harder for some to simultaneously listen to and take notes. If this is a problem for you, it can help to concentrate intently on the lecturer, 
                making very brief notes, and then complete your notes after the lecture. You can also borrow more comprehensive notes from a friend.</li>
            <li>If you are overwhelmed by what you are trying to learn, look for ways to break what you are learning into smaller chunks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How can an octopus help you understand your brain's working memory?
            Hold on to that thought!
            Meanwhile, let's play a game.
            Look at these objects and try to remember as many of them as possible.
            Now pause this video to say out loud as many as you remember.
            How many did you get right?
            In this game, you used your working memory,
            a part of your brain that you use to temporarily hold onto information.
            Working memory is used when you do things like multiply numbers in your head,
            learn new material,
            or think of what to say next.
            Ah!
            We like to think of working memory as an octopus
            that uses it's arms to connect your thoughts.
            It can reach into long term memory to connect sets of links that you've stored there.
            Remember how we said that your long-term memory has an almost unlimited storage capacity?
            Working memory, on the other hand, has a very limited capacity.
            An average working memory can hold only around four thoughts or concepts.
            This means you can think of your mental octopus as having only about four arms.
            But some people have working memories with more arms
            that can hold many more pieces of information,
            while other people have memories with maybe only two or three arms
            that can't hold as much.
            You cannot change the number of arms of your working memory.
            That number is pretty much set.
            Kind of like your height is set.
            If you have fewer arms on your working memory octopus,
            it can sometimes be a struggle for you to hold a lot of information in mind at once.
            But if you take the time and effort to learn a subject well,
            you can way outperform a person who has a larger working memory capacity
            when it comes to that subject.
            How?
            The key is your long-term memory.
            The more relevant information you already have stored in your long-term memory,
            the less working memory you need when learning something new
            or performing a task related to what you know.
            Those sets of links you already have in long-term memory help you with your thinking.
            Whether your working memory is big or small,
            if you give your working memory too much information at once,
            it will have trouble holding on to anything.
            You can end up feeling quite frustrated.
            For example, when you start learning how to ride a bicycle,
            your entire working memory is engaged,
            so you don't have any free capacity to think about what to have for dinner.
            But once you've learned to ride a bike,
            it hardly requires any working memory at all to ride the bike,
            unless perhaps you run into heavy traffic.
            Or when you're learning a difficult physics concept,
            working memory is working away as you study.
            But once you've learned that concept well,
            you can easily use it in your thinking,
            without it occupying much of working memory.
            That's because most of the job is being done by the sets of links in long-term memory,
            not by your working memory.
            The best learning happens when your working memory is hard at work,
            using all of its arms to support your learning.
            That's why it's good to challenge yourself.
            But don't overwork your working memory giving it more than it can handle.
            That will only lead to frustration.
            Let's look at a practical example:
            Notetaking during live classes.
            For many learners, this can be a good way to learn more,
            since it engages more of that working memory.
            But if the class is very difficult,
            or your working memory is smaller than average,
            your working memory will already be working at full capacity
            just trying to pay attention to the lecture.
            You need all that working memory to decipher the instructor's explanations.
            If you're taking notes at the same time that you're listening to the instructor,
            you may not have enough working memory to understand what the instructor is saying.
            If you find yourself in this kind of situation,
            it can be better to borrow someone else's notes,
            or take notes after class.
            Or take only light, key-word based notes.
            This way, you can focus more fully on the instructor,
            without having to divide as much of your attention to your writing.
            This is also one reason why online learning can be better than face-to-face.
            You can take notes without overwhelming your working memory,
            since you can pause the video to write whenever you want.
            As research has shown,
            the key to learning from notetaking is to review the notes,
            using retrieval practice the same day you listened to the lecture.
            If it's late at night and you're exhausted,
            at least do a quick skim to try to bring those key ideas back to mind.
            If possible, do the review right before you go to sleep,
            so your brain is reminded of what is most important to be practicing while you're sleeping,
            without other thoughts getting in the way.
            When you're trying to learn difficult and demanding new concepts,
            that's when your working memory can get overwhelmed
            To avoid this, here's what you should do.
            Before you start learning,
            free your working memory from any non-essential thoughts
            by writing a task list.
            Then your "I've got to do this!"-thoughts are saved in a safe place,
            so you can return to them after your studying.
            Once you're learning, if you feel overwhelmed,
            try to break the materials into smaller, more manageable chunks.
            Then master one piece at a time,
            gradually
            until you've mastered them all.
            This is like how a musician will break a new song into many small segments
            and master the segments one at a time
            before gradually putting them together
            and playing the whole song.
            Let's say you struggle with understanding what equilibrium is in economics.
            Start by tackling the fundamental parts of that concept first:
            supply, then demand,
            before putting it all together to understand the concept of equilibrium.
            Also have something, like this pencil and paper, to write on as you learn,
            so you can jot down words, numbers and thoughts as needed.
            A piece of paper like this can serve as an extension of your working memory,
            a place to store information outside your working memory.
            Images and visual representations can also make it easier for working memory to understand new concepts.
            You can see here how a visual representation of a water molecule
            makes it easier to understand how the atoms connect.
            Pictures accompanied by verbal explanations,
            such as the video you are watching right now,
            also make learning easier for working memory.
            That's because some octopus arms are for visual information,
            and others for auditory information.
            So you can hold more in mind at once.
            Incidentally, that's why it can be easier to learn from a video than a book.
            Videos allow you to see AND hear the explanations.
            But if an explanation is still too difficult to understand,
            you can always look for better alternatives elsewhere.
            Let's go back to the memory question we posed at the start of this video.
            Even with a limited working memory, there is a way to remember all 12 of these items,
            or even more.
            But to do that, you need techniques to quickly stick information into long-term memory.
            We'll look at such memory tricks in video six.
            Now head over to the discussion forum
            and share your best techniques for notetaking

        <h3 id="1.5">1.5 Digging deeper into strengthening your neural links</h3>
        <h4>Key Ideas </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You create stronger sets of links if you break your learning into smaller periods of time, spaced out over several days.</li>
            <li>The strengthening you get during sleep enhances the learning you’ve done each day.</li>
            <li>Exercise can also speed up your learning, because it helps your brain produce BDNF, a kind of neural fertilizer.</li>
            <li>When you not only know a certain idea, but also can see it in a larger context, how it compares and contrasts to other similar ideas, that’s when you build deep understanding.</li>
            <li>It can be smart to connect a new idea to other knowledge that you already have. Associations and metaphors are a great way to do this.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let's return to long-term memory and sets of links.
            More than a century ago, psychologist Herman Ebbinghaus experimented with learning nonsense syllables.
            He found that if he studied over three days instead of two,
            he could cut the number of repetitions needed to learn the syllables in half.
            Since then, experiments across subjects, levels and countries have shown the same findings.
            When you space your study out over several days,
            you learn better, with less overall effort.
            Why does spacing work?
            Every night, your brain does some cleaning,
            getting rid of toes,
            that is, dendritic spines,
            that haven't been used much.
            At the same time, toes that have been used get strengthened.
            If you only study material once, important toes are more likely to be pruned away.
            But if you work with something over several days,
            your brain is able to keep reinforcing important connections,
            while eliminating,
            that is, pruning,
            the unimportant ones.
            On top of all of this, entirely new neurons can also jump into the mix,
            adding still more neural connections.
            These kinds of activities can be observed using a modern technique called light microscopy.
            You're all budding neuroscientists now,
            so you can probably recognize that this is a dendrite,
            the long leg of a neuron.
            And here's another image of that same neuron after learning and after sleep.
            Wherever you see a triangle appearing,
            that indicates a new or an enhanced dendritic spine.
            This means you can create stronger sets of links
            if you break your learning into smaller periods of time,
            spaced out over several days.
            The strengthening you get during sleep
            enhances the learning you've done each day.
            Exercise can also speed up your learning,
            because it helps your brain produce BDNF,
            a protein that works as a kind of fertilizer,
            helping your neurons grow more and stronger toes.
            This in turn makes it easier for the neurons to connect.
            Exercise produces other substances that also boost learning.
            We don't know what type of exercise benefits learning most,
            but regular exercise is the best.
            In one study, 20 minutes of interval training, three times per week
            led to 10 % improvement in memory.
            At least 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise, 5 days per week
            is recommended by many health organizations worldwide.
            Let's look at how sets of links connect to one another.
            When you learn a chord on the guitar,
            you form a single set of links.
            But when you learn to play an entire song that includes that chord,
            you form a much larger web of sets of links.
            The same logic applies when you learn a simple fact,
            for example, that Germany invaded Poland on September 1st, 1939.
            You start that by forming a small set of links for that fact.
            But when you connect that single fact to what you know about the Second World War,
            that set of links becomes part of a much larger intertwined web of links.
            When you not only know a certain idea, but also can see it in a larger context,
            how it compares and contrasts to other similar ideas,
            that's when you build deep understanding.
            And for any set of links,
            The more other sets of links you connect it too,
            the stickier your new learning becomes.
            Part of the reason for this stickiness is that it's easier to remember something
            when you have several paths to reach any given set of links.
            So when you learn a new idea,
            the more you can connect it to things you already know,
            the better you'll learn it.
            For example,
            let's say you learn about the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility in economics.
            This law says that the pleasure you get from consuming items
            diminishes the more items you consume.
            It can be smart to pause to connect this to personal experience,
            for example that the first piece of chocolate tastes much better than the 10th piece.
            Unless you're like Barb!
            By connecting this seemingly esoteric idea of diminishing marginal utility to eating chocolate,
            you've already connected the concept to another solid and well-known set of links.
            There are two other ways you can use to capitalize on prior knowledge:
            associations and metaphors.
            When you're learning a new idea and you think
            "you know, this reminds me of..."
            you've just formed an association.
            Let's say you're learning the Chinese character for person:
            "ren"
            which I'm mispronouncing terribly
            but the character itself can be easily forgotten again.
            But if you try to associate it with something you already know,
            it'll stick better.
            For example,
            you can see the similarities between the character
            and a human stick figure with two legs at the bottom,
            and then you can just imagine it walking away with those two legs.
            A metaphor is when you take a phenomenon you already know
            and use it to help you better understand what you're learning.
            You may have noticed we've used a lot of metaphors in this course.
            For example, we have used sets of links as a metaphor for how neurons connect,
            tiny drones flying over a maze to explain the diffuse mode,
            and an octopus to explain working memory.
            A difficult idea can seem simple if you just find the right metaphor.
            Good teachers and textbooks often use metaphors.
            For example, in biology,
            mitochondria are often explained as supplying energy for cells,
            kind of like tiny batteries.
            Metaphors help you learn more quickly
            because you can use sets of links you've already built
            that are related to familiar concepts as blueprints
            when forming new sets of links.
            In neuroscience, this is related to a concept known as neural reuse theory.
            You'll always find some parts of your metaphor that
            don't apply to the new concept you're mastering,
            but the point isn't to find a perfect metaphor.
            It's just to find a metaphor that works to explain a key aspect of what you're trying to learn.
            Don't worry if at first it takes time to find a good metaphor or association.
            The time you're taking will pay off in making what you're learning easier to remember.
            And you'll understand it better.
            With practice, you'll find your ability to make metaphors or associations improving.
            Now it's time to head over to the discussion forum
            and share some of your best metaphors and associations.

        <h3 id="1.6">1.6 How to memorize more easily</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Having some critical pieces of knowledge memorized, nestled nicely in your long-term memory, can be very helpful.</li>
            <li>Some of the best ways to memorize include:

                    <li>Retrieval practice</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Do you struggle to remember the names of all the planets in our solar system in order?
            Well, this woman can help you with that. Here's how it works.
            Hang on before we get to that, whether you're learning new technology terms,
            foreign vocabulary, or theoretical models and concepts,
            smart memorization techniques can help you commit the new information to memory more quickly.
            But is it really necessary to memorize anything anymore
            now that we can look up anything anytime?
            Actually, having some critical pieces of knowledge memorized,
            nestled nicely in your long-term memory,
            can be very helpful.
            When you already have some neural links created in long-term memory about a topic
            it makes it much easier to add more links.
            And having those links at the tip of your mental fingertips
            allows you to think faster and at a higher level.
            Barb's got a great point.
            As we've seen, when you already have some sets of links built into long-term memory
            you make things a lot easier for your brain's working memory.
            Let's say you were asked to compare and contrast the French and the American Revolutions.
            A higher conceptual level question like that
            requires that you know a set of seemingly unrelated lower-level facts about both revolutions.
            But memory and understanding are kind of interlinked.
            It's easier to memorize information when you understand it well.
            But it's also easier to understand information that you've memorized.
            So what's the best way then to memorize information?
            Well, as you know, one of the best ways to create strong sets of links in long-term memory
            is to use retrieval practice.
            Instead of simply reading or looking at the information over and over
            test yourself on it.
            Try to retrieve it from your own memory.
            Of course, a powerful way to do that is to use flash cards.
            Simply write down what you need to memorize on one side
            and the translation or explanation on the other side.
            Then go through the cards and try to retrieve what's on the other side.
            Check to see whether you have it right.
            It's smart to shuffle the cards every now and then, and to alternate the direction you read them in,
            so sometimes you see the back first, sometimes the front.
            As you improve, you separate the difficult cards from the easier ones.
            Practice more with those you struggle with.
            Whether you study with flash cards or use another approach,
            remember to space out your sessions over several days.
            You can also use memory tricks called mnemonics.
            One trick that can help you memorize a group of words is to see if they can form an acronym.
            Acronyms are all around us.
            And they're powerful, because they can combine many words into one.
            Kind of like how a rubber band ties together several flowers into a bouquet.
            To form an acronym, you'll have to play around with the order of the words
            to find the most memorable combination.
            If that doesn't work, you can use a related technique,
            forming a sentence in which each word corresponds to a word on your list.
            The sentence "My Very Elderly Mother Just Served Us Noodles",
            remember her?
            could represent the planets in order:
            Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
            Another technique you can use is to form an image.
            Actually, some 50 % of the neocortex is devoted to processing visual information,
            meaning you have a super memory for images.
            In one study that demonstrated this, participants were shown 2560 images.
            A few days later, they remembered 90 % of the images they had seen!
            So when you're trying to remember a fact or a word,
            try to come up with a mental image for it.
            This is similar to the association technique we mentioned in the last video.
            If you want to remember that the moon landing happened in 1969,
            you can try to come up with an image of a moon looking like the number 69.
            Or to remember that the South Pole was reached in 1911,
            you can make a mental image of a person skiing down two poles.
            Hah, that's me at the South Pole 70 years later!
            But that's a whole 'nother story.
            Actually, image-based memory techniques are what memory champions use
            to memorize an entire deck of cards in less than 20 seconds.
            The most well-known of these techniques is the Memory Palace.
            To use the Memory Palace, you just come up with an image for every word or phrase you want to remember,
            and then place those images in a building that you're familiar with.
            That's where the name memory palace comes from.
            Let's say you want to memorize the first five elements of the periodic table:
            Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium, Beryllium and Boron.
            First you come up with an image for each of the five elements.
            We'll use these images:
            A fire hydrant, a helium balloon, a battery, a strawberry and a boar.
            Some images are chosen because they're typically associated with the elements,
            such as a battery for Lithium.
            Other images are chosen because the sound of the object leaves a helpful clue,
            such as strawberry for Beryllium.
            Next, you find a location that you are familiar with.
            Let's choose our home.
            We'll make a route through the rooms,
            stopping at the entrance door, the hallway, the kitchen, living room and bedroom.
            Finally, walk through your palace and envision the images along the way.
            The fire hydrant in front of the entrance door,
            the balloon in the hallway,
            the battery in the kitchen,
            strawberries in the living room
            and the boar in the bedroom.
            The memory palace techniques works so well
            because it glues new information to locations that are already in your long-term memory.
            Speaking of learning new information, how's your Norwegian learning going?
            Uh, I've memorized a few words.
            So would you say that you can speak Norwegian now?
            Uh, let's find out in the next video,

        <h2>Week 2: Two different types of learning systems</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3 id="2.1">2.1 Introduction to the declarative and procedural systems</h3>
        <h4>Key Ideas</h4>
        <ul><li>Links in long-term memory are deposited through two different systems: <strong>the declarative and the procedural systems</strong>. 
            Both types of links are needed to really understand what you’re learning.</li>
        <li>The declarative system uses the hippocampus—it is what you use when you are first consciously trying to learn something.</li>
        <li>The procedural system uses the basal ganglia—it generally learns information that’s hard to explain, like physical skills. 
            The procedural system helps you gain speed and ease with whatever you’re doing, such as speaking a foreign language or working mathematical-type problems.</li>
        <li>The procedural system is like a black box—you can never be aware of how it learns—you can only be aware of what has come out as a 
            result of procedural system processing. It needs lots of practice to do its learning.</li>
        <li>The procedural system has two paths:
            <ul>
                <li>Goal-based learning—you can prod this part of the procedural system with your working memory.</li>
                <li>Habit-based learning—this is used for physical actions, like learning to ride a bike, and other activities you do without even paying much attention, 
                    like typing. The “black box” of the procedural system learns slowly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The declarative system is fast to learn but slow to use.</li>
        <li>The procedural system is slow to learn but fast to use.</li></ul>
        <p>Barb, let's hear the Norwegian you've been learning.
            [speaking broken Norwegian]
            You're getting better, but I wouldn't call you fluent yet.
            To become fluent, it's not enough to know the words of a new language.
            You have to be able to access them swiftly,
            so that you can understand the quick sentences of native speakers
            and speak effortlessly yourself.
            For that, you need the brain's powerful, yet mysterious procedural learning system.
            We've already talked about how you form sets of links in long-term memory.
            But we haven't yet mentioned that there are two different systems you use to deposit those links:
            the declarative and the procedural systems.
            These systems deposit links in different places of long-term memory.
            To really understand what you're learning,
            you often need both declarative AND procedural sets of links in your long-term memory.
            Oops, that went by really fast.
            Let's rewind this and explain more slowly and clearly.
            The declarative system is what you use when you are first consciously trying to learn something.
            For example, when you're trying to memorize a new word in a foreign language.
            Or understand how cardiac function works.
            Or learn a new technique in math.
            Declarative learning progresses step by logical step.
            The declarative system takes information from working memory,
            it goes through the hippocampus and into long-term memory.
            You're mostly conscious of your thinking through the declarative system.
            The procedural system, on the other hand, goes through your basal ganglia.
            Unlike the declarative system, you're not aware of how the procedural system learns.
            But you ARE aware of the outcome when you learned it...
            ...or not!
            The procedural learning system has two streams that flow into making neural links.
            This stream on the left, coming from working memory and the front of your brain, involves goal-based learning.
            You can see the goal-based learning in action as this man hits the golf ball.
            He's consciously using his working memory to tell his procedural system to hit that golf ball.
            Once the orders from working memory input go into the procedural system,
            the man doesn't really know what's going on.
            The procedural system is like a black box,
            a box that somehow, almost magically, gradually figures out how to put that ball into the hole,
            or whatever else it's trying to learn.
            People are not aware of how the procedural system is doing its learning
            but they are aware of whether or not a hit was successful and they actually sink the ball into the hole.
            Feedback about whether a hit was successful
            is how the procedural system slowly learns what it is supposed to do.
            The other stream of your procedural system involves the habit system.
            This stream is what you use when you're learning a habit
            like the route you habitually use to drive a car or bike to work.
            In fact, it's the same system you used to learn to ride a bike.
            The black box of the procedural system learns slowly.
            It needs lots of practice to do its learning.
            But once it's learned how to do something,
            watch out,
            it's really fast!
            You learn lots of things by using your procedural system.
            Sports, aspects of mathematics, and speaking your native language.
            [Norwegian tongue twister]
            The procedural system is even what you rely on to type on a keyboard.
            This system's slow to learn.
            After all, that black box has to have lots of inputs and outputs in order to learn.
            But once it's learned something, it can be very fast to react.
            That's why you can type so quickly.
            However, the procedural system's also inflexible.
            Just try to type if someone's switched around the keys on a keyboard!
            Or try driving on the other side of the road when you visit a foreign country with different driving habits.
            We've learned a LOT about the procedural system in this video.
            In the next video, let's tie these ideas together to see how they can help you learn better.</p>

        <li>Procedural learning helps you be faster and more comfortable with material you are learning. To enhance your procedural as well as declarative links in

        <li>Internalization by learning to listen to your internal whispers as you repeatedly solve problems until they seem natural and easy will help you 
            build an internal scaffold (a “schema”) that will allow you to more easily learn new material related to those problems.</li>
        <li>Interleaving different types of problems as you internalize will help develop your procedural sets of links.</li></ul>
        <p>All right, we're back for the exciting rest of the story of how to use both your declarative
            and procedural systems to help you learn better.
            Let's look at an example.
            Say you're learning a new language.
            When you first begin your studies, you might use flash cards and different kinds of rules of grammar
            to help you understand what you're learning.
            As you do this, you are learning consciously, through that declarative system.
            Incidentally, memory tricks such as those that we've taught earlier
            work by depositing those sets of links through the declarative system.
            But you may notice something a little strange:
            As you study a foreign language, you can remember the words,
            you can form correct sentences
            but you do this very slowly and it's really hard.
            You can't think and speak quickly and naturally, like a native speaker can.
            In fact, when you start trying to converse with a native speaker,
            sometimes the words you thought you knew don't come out at all!
            This is because, when you are learning a foreign language,
            your first sets of links are deposited mostly through that declarative system.
            These links are quicker to put into place than links that are laid by the procedural system.
            But declarative links, they're slower to use.
            [Speaking broken Norwegian]
            If you listen, read, and speak freely in your new language,
            you slowly begin to strengthen those new links of vocabulary and grammar through the procedural system.
            Your procedural sets of links grow and strengthen,
            so you speak more fluently and with less effort.
            You have a goal in mind of what you want to say,
            and you pass that goal on to the black box of the procedural system.
            Again, and then again, and then again.
            With plenty of practice, out will come that verbiage that you need in the new language,
            without you even having to think much about what you're saying.
            Your procedural system helps you learn the patterns of a language,
            and allows you to speak rapidly,
            but without having to concentrate on how to say what you want to say.
            The same applies for learning to drive.
            In the beginning, you use your declarative system to remind yourself to, for example, signal when you are going to turn.
            But with practice, signaling a turn becomes something you do automatically.
            In other words, you develop sets of links growing through the habit stream of the procedural system.
            You can even do things like drive home automatically, while thinking about other things,
            because you are drawing from those procedural sets of links in long-term memory to do the routine driving.
            The declarative system learns through structure, explanations, and step-by-step examples.
            The procedural system, on the other hand, learns through immersion and feeling out the patterns and rules on its own.
            How does this happen?
            Mostly, through lots and lots of varied, interleaved practice.
            Notice that the declarative and the procedural systems can learn the same information.
            They just allow you to use that information differently.
            Either slowly and with sometimes difficult thought,
            or quickly, without even thinking about it.
            Let's talk some more about how you can create strong sets of links using your procedural system.
            We'll start with something you probably already know,
            but it's worth repeating because now you can understand why this point is true.
            Just because you can recite the definition for something
            does not necessarily mean you understand that concept.
            Why?
            It's because you can learn the definition declaratively,
            but you grow to fully and truly understand that concept only through lots and lots of procedural practice.
            Let's talk about math.
            It can often be relatively straightforward to learn math declaratively.
            Just follow the step-by-step procedure you've been taught to solve the problem.
            But declarative learning is only part of learning math.
            Let's look at how we can use the procedural system to develop your problem-solving intuition for math and other numerical subjects
            To do this, we're going to show you how to use a process we call internalization.
            Here's how you internalize:
            First, pick an important-looking problem where the complete worked solution is available.
            But don't look at that solution.
            Instead, listen to your internal voice and see if you can solve each step of the problem.
            At first, do this by hand, on paper, to prevent yourself from thinking you know how to solve it
            when you actually don't.
            Only peek at the solution if you get stuck.
            You might need to look at the solution repeatedly,
            but don't be discouraged.
            Then rework the problem again that day,
            until you can get through the whole problem by pulling the solution from your own mind
            without peeking at the answer.
            Practice again here and there over the next few days,
            until you're so capable that you can just look at the problem and know how to solve it.
            The steps flow as naturally as a song in your mind.
            You'll be surprised at how much more easily and quickly you can solve that problem as the days go by.
            What you are doing is developing procedural fluency with the key ideas of the problem.
            You internalize several different problems in a day.
            This internalization will help your brain develop an intuition for how to solve various types of problems,
            because you will develop a natural feel for the differences and similarities of the different types.
            Developing a feel for patterns, and being able to rapidly and intuitively solve problems
            is the forte of the procedural system.
            Notice that you are not MEMORIZING how to solve the problems.
            Instead, you are internalizing problems,
            letting your intuition whisper the next step toward the solution.
            Internalizing some of the most important problems in the area you are learning
            creates a sort of scaffold in your brain.
            This scaffold,
            well, technically, it's called a schema,
            will allow you to more easily learn new, related problems.
            From a practical perspective, your internalized scaffold of key ideas will allow you to more easily see how to solve problems,
            especially when time matters!
            People often learn by blocking.
            That is, they might solve ten problems of a certain type
            and then ten more problems of another type
            and then perhaps ten more of yet another type.
            But it's much better, once you've got a feel for certain kinds of problems,
            to interleave with other kinds of somewhat different problems.
            Mixing up the types of problems you solve, lets your procedural system
            develop a sense of the different patterns needed to solve related, but somewhat differing problems.
            You can do interleaving in all sorts of subjects.
            For example, mix up the flash cards of different artistic styles,
            instead of just studying one style in block.
            When you practice verb conjugation, you should mix up several tenses in the same session.
            Interleaving different types of problems or concepts will help you learn the differences between them
            and allow you to pick the right approach intuitively,
            since it helps strengthen procedural links.
            To improve a skill, whether it is managing people, being a better negotiator, or becoming a wizard at Excel,
            both declarative and procedural systems play a role.
            Feed your declarative system with new insights and tactics by reading books,
            taking online courses,
            such as this one,
            or in-person courses.
            Feed your procedural system through plenty of actual practice.
            Your declarative and procedural systems inform one another as you build your skills.
            When you study online, you have the freedom to choose when and how to study.
            But how do you make sure all that freedom doesn't result in all play and no studying?
            The key to success probably isn't what you think.</p>

        <h3 id="2.3">2.3 How to succeed with online learning and improve your self-discipline</h3>
        <h4>Key Ideas</h4>
        <ul><li>To maximize learning from online courses, it’s not enough to watch videos and read articles, you need to process the content more actively, 
            e.g. by taking notes, relating the content to what you already know, applying it in your life or work and by discussing the content with colleagues, 
            friends or in forums.</li>
        <li>Watching the same videos several times isn’t the best way to spend your study time. You will learn more by watching a video only once 
            and then spend the extra time working actively with the information, for example, by making notes.</li>
        <li>Self-discipline can help you stick to your learning goal, but is an unreliable aide, so it’s better to find ways to get things done that don’t 
            rely on your self-discipline. </li>
        <li>Planning when, where, and how you will study is a good idea. Students who plan their studies spend more time studying.</li>
        <li>One powerful planning technique is to do a <strong>“WOOP” (Wish, Outcome, Obstacles, Plan)</strong> every evening, before you go to sleep, 
            and reaffirming those thoughts in the morning before the day’s work begins.</li>
        <li>Good habits grow from the procedural system. They help you get on and keep on task without even thinking about it.</li></ul>
        <p>Lots of people think self-discipline is the key to succeeding with online learning.
            Do you think people can train their self-discipline,
            for example by submerging their hand into a bucket of ice cold water?
            I don't know about that,
            but I do know that having self-discipline can be less important than you think.
            We'll get back to that, but first, let's discuss how to learn better from online courses.
            #$@&%*!
            When you take an online course, you read articles and you watch videos, like this one.
            That gives you an overview of the material.
            But to learn the material well, you'll need to process what you're learning more actively.
            You'll want to think about how the content relates to what you already know.
            And you'll want to take notes, as well as to try to apply what you've learned.
            You'll want to discuss the content with friends or colleagues on forums.
            That's why we've encouraged you several times to participate in our forum.
            What about skipping active learning and instead watching all videos twice?
            What about skipping active learning and instead watching all videos twice?
            [clearing throat]
            Research has shown that you will learn more by watching a video only one time
            and then spending the extra time working actively with the information,
            for example, making notes that synthesize the information,
            and seeing if you can retrieve those key ideas.
            The rise of online courses has made education more accessible, affordable and flexible.
            Here on edX for example, you have access to lectures from some of the world's leading experts
            whenever and from wherever you want.
            But compared to traditional classroom education,
            all this flexibility and freedom puts greater responsibility on you to structure your studying.
            It's kind of like exercising on your own instead of with others.
            Self-discipline can help, but it's also a risky bet.
            Self-discipline is like an unreliable friend.
            It's hard to know if self-discipline will be there for you to help.
            Therefore, it's better to find ways to get things done that reduce the need for self-discipline.
            For example, you can plan ahead.
            Psychologists have found that if you plan when, where, and how you will study,
            you're more likely to actually do it.
            One experiment showed that students who planned when and where they would study
            ended up spending 50 % more time studying.
            That's a lot!
            So to help you with online learning,
            or actually any learning,
            it can be a good idea to set aside 30 minutes a day,
            preferably at a specific time,
            where you study a specific subject.
            Psychologists have also found that if you think ahead about likely obstacles
            and how you'll respond to those obstacles,
            you'll be much more likely to overcome them.
            For this, you can use the WOOP technique.
            Think of something you wish to get done.
            Then think about the best outcome or feeling from getting that done.
            Then think about the likely obstacles that could prevent your outcome.
            Finally, devise plans to get around those obstacles.
            Let's say for example you plan to study for an hour after work.
            That's your wish.
            If you can get it done, you'll feel much better and you can play your favorite video game, guilt free.
            A possible obstacle, however, is that you'll be tired after work,
            so you don't feel like studying.
            You make a plan that if you are tired,
            you'll get cracking anyway, starting by doing a Pomodoro.
            The next day, if you actually do feel tired,
            you'll be more likely to respond just as you had planned to respond.
            For example,
            one experiment showed that students who thought ahead about likely obstacles and how to respond to those obstacles,
            completed 60 % more practice problems for an important test than students who didn't.
            We recommend that you do a WOOP for the next day every evening before you go to sleep
            and then reaffirm that WOOP the next morning.
            Another helpful approach is to take control of your environment,
            to make it more conducive to what you want to achieve.
            Let's say you wanted to go to the gym in the morning
            and that's a good idea, because as you know, exercise is helpful for learning.
            You know you'll struggle to get out of bed.
            But if you pack your bag the night before,
            and put the alarm clock in the rom at the end opposite to your bed,
            you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
            And with your things already packed, you've made it as easy as possible to follow through.
            Similarly, you can take control of your study environment.
            Close down any windows on your laptop that aren't relevant to your learning ahead of time.
            Not this window!
            Using web-site blockers can also help you stay on task.
            All these ideas will help you build a structure around your learning
            and will help you succeed without relying on self-discipline.
            It'll take some conscious planning and effort from your side,
            but with time, these practices will transform into good learning habits.
            And good habits are invaluable because they grow from your procedural system
            meaning that you do what you're supposed to be doing without even thinking about it!
            Although good habits can take practice to develop,
            they can become your personal autopilot in your path to success.

        <h4>Key Ideas</h4>
        <ul><li>Motivation is what gives you energy to act and to pursue goals.</li>
        <li>Release of dopamine in your brain creates motivation. Dopamine-producing cells operate in two modes: phasic and tonic.</li>

        <p>A boy named Tom was once sentenced to whitewash his aunt's fence as punishment for skipping school.
            He hated his punishment.
            But within a short time, Tom got all the other kids on the street to paint the fence for him.
            How did he motivate them to do it?
            We'll return to Tom in a moment.
            What is motivation anyway?
            Motivation is what gives you energy to act and to pursue goals.
            It's like a fuel for the mind.
            What unleashes that fuel is a molecule called dopamine,
            which is produced by dopamine-producing cells in the brain.
            This is true for animals too.
            For example, rats with high dopamine levels will work harder to overcome obstacles to obtain food.
            Let's look at how these dopamine producing cells work,
            and how you can increase the dopamine production.
            Dopamine-producing cells operate in two modes:
            phasic and tonic.
            Phasic operation involves short bursts of dopamine around your brain when you experience an unexpected reward.
            When someone surprises you with an unexpected gift or complement,
            phasic dopamine helps give you that exciting or good feeling.
            Phasic dopamine is also released when your curiosity is unexpectedly satisfied.
            So when you're curious about something you're trying to learn,
            and BOOM,
            that curiosity is suddenly satisfied,
            phasic dopamine squirts out!
            This dopamine even sniffs out those neural connections that have recently been used
            and strengthens them.
            So getting curious about what you're trying to learn is truly great for learning.
            It helps both directly, through strengthening those links,
            and indirectly, through strengthening your motivation.
            Understanding dopamine's role in strengthening neural connections by filling knowledge gaps in your learning
            helps you understand another important idea in learning.
            If you're just spending time working on the easy stuff that you've already learned,
            you won't get those phasic dopamine bursts that help you consolidate your new learning.
            On the other hand, if you work with things that are just too difficult,
            you'll only get frustrated.
            Your projects should therefore be doable with effort.
            If a task is too difficult, try to break it up, or get help, or give yourself some more time,
            or maybe find better resources such as the many great teachers you can find online.
            Let's move to tonic operation.
            Tonic operation just sprinkles lower, but more steady levels of dopamine around your brain
            when you work on a specific task, or toward a long-term goal that has some kind of reward attached to it.
            Something you value.
            Tonic dopamine is your brain's way of keeping you motivated on the road to the expected reward.
            The low levels of tonic dopamine around your brain are kind of like the background music you hear everywhere
            as you walk around a large department store.
            Tonic dopamine responds to expected rewards by increasing your motivation.
            What's really interesting is that we can increase our tonic dopamine levels,
            that is, our motivation for a task,
            by using simple mental tools that clarify rewards for the brain.
            Your brain, after all, is all about what's in it for you!
            Let's look at some of these mental tools.
            You're consciously aware of the reward from learning something that you can immediately and obviously benefit from,
            such as learning to drive a car.
            Knowing the reward lies ahead of you helps keep that tonic dopamine flowing.
            But some subjects, say, math, may not be obviously useful,
            so the dopamine-producing cells might not see it as rewarding to learn.
            The result?
            Less dopamine.
            That's why it's smart to identify the value of a learning task before you start.
            Think about how you can use what you learn and the opportunities that your new learning will give you.
            Write those ideas down.
            You're making it easier for your brain to see the reward.
            Another helpful technique is consequence mapping.
            On a piece of paper or mentally, answer the question:
            what are the consequences if I do this, and what are the consequences if I don't?
            Again, this helps you see the value of a reward, which boosts those tonic dopamine levels.
            Identifying value can be equally important when you face failure,
            as you inevitably will
            Instead of thinking "I failed, I'm hopeless," find and focus on the positive in the situation.
            Tell yourself
            "I've learned a lot from this experience and because of it, will be more likely to succeed in the future."
            Changing your perception of a situation is called reframing.
            That's the technique that Tom Sawyer used to motivate his friends to paint the fence for him.
            Tom refused to call the painting job work.
            He instead presented painting as a once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity to try something new.
            Convinced by this perception, the other kids then started offering small gifts
             in return for being allowed to paint.
            When you analyze why you failed, it's also important to know that how you attribute failure
            also affects your motivational dopamine levels.
            This is called attribution.
            If you tell yourself you failed because you're stupid,
            you are telling your dopamine-producing cells that there is no point in producing dopamine to motivate you next time
            since you don't stand a chance anyway.
            Instead, you should look at what you DID and what you can do DIFFERENTLY next time.
            Perhaps you underestimated the task, or didn't set aside enough time.
            Or perhaps you procrastinated away most of your preparation time,
            or didn't pay enough attention to the instructions.
            Another way to make the rewards clearer is having an exciting long-term goal.
            Something meaningful that gives you a good feeling whenever you think about it.
            This kind of goal can involve obtaining a job qualification,
            reaching a career ambition, or achieving the kind of life you want.
            Having a small object or photo handy that represents this goal will act as a reminder and keep you motivated.
            But your dopamine producing cells can sometime struggle if the reward seems too far away.
            A long-term goal should therefore be supplemented by milestone goals,
            goals that act as steps on the way to your long-term goal.
            Completing an online course can be an example of such a milestone goal.
            Attaching an extra reward to the milestones,
            such as celebrating with a dinner out,
            can also help excite dopamine producing cells.
            But daily or weekly process goals are what will really help move you toward your milestones and long-term goal.
            Process goals are actionable goals that say how you'll work to get somewhere.
            An example of a process goal can be to study for one hour every day or read a book per week.
            Interacting with other learners can also help motivate you.
            And if those other learners are more motivated than you, some of their motivation can transfer to you,
            a phenomenon called motivation contagion.
            So it's always a good idea to find someone who shares some of your learning objectives to collaborate or interact with.
            Helpful learning with collaborators can also do a lot to reduce your stress levels.
            So head on over to the discussion forum and other learners know your favorite ways of motivating yourself.
            And see if you can get a few ideas from your classmates as well!
            In the next video, we'll look at a perennially important question:
            how to remember more from reading.</p>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p></p>

        <h3 id="2.5">2.5 How to read effectively</h3>
        <h4>Key Ideas</h4>
        <ul><li>Your reading speed is determined by processing in your brain, not by how quickly your eyes can glide across the text.</li>
        <li>Trying to read more quickly is not the way to read more effectively. If you try to increase your reading speed beyond what 
            feels natural, your comprehension will suffer. Speed reading techniques don’t work. </li>
        <li>To read more effectively, preview the text, practice recall, and work actively with the text, for example by discussing it with others or annotating it.</li>
        <li>Reading about something from multiple sources (and perspectives) gives you a deeper understanding.</li></ul>
        <p>How long does it take to read the 784-page book "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"?
            In 2007, Anne Jones sat down in a London bookstore and finished the entire book in 47 minutes.
            That's about 20 times faster than the average reader!
            Anne was using a technique called speed reading.
            Could that be the secret to reading effectively?
            I mean, it would be great if we could all finish books like these in less than an hour.
            But is it possible?
            When you read, your eyes don't glide across the page,
            they move in jumps,
            stopping briefly at each word to read it before moving on to the next word.
            What speed-reading advocates will tell you is to reduce these jumps,
            either by practicing reading three words at a time
            or by using an app that flashes words so your eyes don't need to move at all.
            Speed-reading advocates will also tell you to never go back to reread words or sentences.
            Well, good luck with that if you're studying calculus!
            These kinds of techniques do help you get through a text more quickly.
            But what about your comprehension?
            Can you actually understand what you're reading?
            It turns out that when you read a word,
            say "house"
            your brain first recognizes that word,
            then it silently pronounces it.
            Finally, your brain converts the written word to its meaning,
            in this case, a place to live in.
            This processing happens when your eyes stop to focus on a word,
            but it continues during the jump to the next word.
            So just eliminating eye jumps with speed reading techniques doesn't give your brain enough time to process the words.
            The result?
            Your comprehension goes down.
            Speed-reading can help you get a rough idea of the text,
            and if that's all you need or have time for, speed-reading can get the job done.
            But so can simple skimming.
            So what's a normal reading speed?
            The average for educated adults is around 225 words per minute.
            But of course, it's slower for difficult or foreign language texts.
            Fewer than 1 % can read above 400 words per minute.
            To compare, Americans like Barb typically speak at 150 words per minute.
            By reading a lot, you can improve your reading speed somewhat.
            This is because reading helps you build your vocabulary, background knowledge
            and your ability to easily recognize words you've commonly encountered.
            But there is a limit.
            Some people will always be able to read faster than others,
            simply because their brains can process words faster.
            But effective reading isn't about speed.
            It's about understanding what you read and remembering it.
            Engaging actively with the text will help you with that.
            Let's look at some scientifically proven practices.
            We'll start with Previewing.
            Just as it's easier to put together a jigsaw puzzle if you've seen a picture of the completed puzzle,
            it's easier to make sense of all the details in the text if you have a big picture view.
            So before you dive in to read carefully, spend a minute or three to look over the text.
            See how long it is, and skim through any summaries
            and look at headings, subheadings, illustrations, and pictures.
            The next strategy is active recall.
            Put the text away and try to remember the key ideas underlying what you've just read.
            Then look through the text to see how well you did.
            You can do active recall at the end of the text you're reading,
            or several times throughout.
            One study found that active recall doubled retention,
            and another that it increased retention 25 %
            compared to spending the same time re-reading.
            A third strategy is to annotate.
            Underline or highlight important sentences
            and then write comments, important ideas and questions.
            Use your own words and be very specific,
            for example
            "5 presidents in 2 years" instead of "Lots of presidents."
            The fourth strategy is to reflect.
            Pause to think about the text,
            what that text means, and how the text relates to what you already know.
            If you have the time, also try to discuss the content with others later, face-to-face or in writing.
            A fifth method is to use multiple sources.
            Look at this car.
            By adding photos from different angles, we get a better understanding of its design.
            When you read, you'll also get a better understanding if you read about the same idea from different texts.
            So how could Anne Jones read a Harry Potter book in only 47 minutes?
            Well, Anne's comprehension was never scientifically measured.
            She simply talked a little about the book to reporters.
            Having read all previous Harry Potter books probably helped a lot.
            Could she have used her same techniques to study a book on Portuguese grammar?
            We doubt it.
            In the next and final video, we'll look at how you can get the most out of the tools you've learned in this course.</p>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p></p>

        <h3 id="2.6">2.6 Putting it all together - How to learn like a Pro</h3>
        <h4>Key Ideas</h4>
        <ul><li>To be a pro learner, you need to have a toolbox of effective tools, but also know when and how to best use those tools. For this, you need metacognition.</li>
        <li>Metacognition is like a brain outside your brain that thinks about your learning and how you can improve.</li>
        <li>One way to be more metacognitive is to follow a process for learning consisting of 3 phases:
            <ol>
                <li>Planning: Before you start learning, think about how to best learn and which tools to use.</li>
                <li>Learning: During your learning, stop briefly now and then to see if you are working effectively or if you should change something.</li>
                <li>Evaluation: Look back at your learning and determine what you did well and what you can do better next time.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you've ever watched a popular talent show on television,
            you've probably seen completely talentless contestants
            blow their stack in anger when the judges tell them the truth:
            their performance is terrible.
            But here's the important question:
            How can some people think they're so good at something when they obviously are not?
            We'll get to that, but first, let's do a quick review.
            In this course, we've looked at how learning well means connecting neurons into strong sets of links
            that are deposited through either the declarative or the procedural system.
            We've looked at how working memory helps deposit links through the declarative system,
            and that you shouldn't overwhelm your working memory.
            We've also looked at how your brain's diffuse mode can help connect links when you are stuck
            and how dopamine can improve learning directly
            and indirectly through boosting your motivation.
            Based on these insights, we've presented a number of powerful techniques that you can use to learn more effectively,
            including Retrieval practice,
            Spacing,
            Interleaving,
            Metaphors and associations,
            Internalization,
            and Memory palace
            These learning techniques are like tools in your learning toolbox.
            To be a Pro Learner, you need just such a well-equipped mental toolbox.
            But how do you make sure that you use the right tool for the right learning challenge?
            And that you use the tool in the best possible way?
            And that you keep expanding your toolbox?
            Say hello to metacognition.
            Metacognition literally means you're thinking about your thinking.
            It can be thought of as having an extra brain that thinks about how well you're actually learning,
            and how you can learn better.
            It's what helps you get the most out of your mental toolbox, and your learning in general.
            Pro learners are metacognitive.
            Part of the reason they've become pros, is because they assess and reflect on their own learning.
            Angry talent show contestants on the other hand, are not very metacognitive.
            They don't objectively analyze how good or how bad they actually are
            and how to improve.
            That's why they get so surprised when the judges give their verdict.
            So how can you become more metacognitive?
            Start thinking about your own learning!
            To help you with that, you can use a model that breaks learning into 3 phases:
            Before, which is when you plan your learning.
            During, which is when you learn.
            And after, which is when you evaluate your learning.
            Let's say that you want to learn Spanish.
            The planning phase is when you analyze the learning task,
            set goals and plan how you'll learn the language,
            including which tools to use.
            Perhaps you plan to use language learning apps and flash cards 15 minutes every day
            to build vocabulary through that declarative system using retrieval practice.
            And then complement that with practicing with a native speaker for one hour twice a week
            to help build fluency using the procedural system.
            The learning phase is when you sit down to learn,
            but in this phase, it's also important that you monitor your own learning
            and make necessary adjustments where you need to.
            This process is kind of like how a good photographer will look at his photos as he shoots them
            and then adjust camera settings to get just the right level of exposure and sharpness.
            This means when you're learning, it's good to take little micro breaks every now and then
            to think about your learning and how it's unfolding,
            and decide whether you should change anything.
            Perhaps you realize that you can work even more effectively with your flash cards if you interleave them,
            mixing up words from different topics
            and changing the order from time to time.
            In the evaluation phase, you look back at your learning session or sessions,
            to think about what went well and identify room for improvement.
            You might conclude that using the app is more fun and motivating than flash cards,
            so you decide to use app only for building your vocabulary.
            Or perhaps you realize that you don't get along too well with the native speaker,
            so you decide to find someone you'll have better chemistry with.
            The result of your evaluation could be that you change your learning plan all together,
            and so you're back at the first phase, planning your learning.
            Learning often goes through many such cycles,
            so you not only continue to improve your learning of whatever you are studying,
            but also become better at learning itself.
            Now it's time for you to evaluate your learning from this course.
            So head on over to the discussion forums
            and let your fellow learners know what you found the most useful in this course
            and see what other learners thought.
            We hope you have enjoyed this course, and we wish you the best of luck.
